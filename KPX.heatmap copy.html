      <p><h1>Jiseok AHN </h1></p>
    
  
      <p>Hello! I'm Jiseok AHN. I work at Korea Institute of Energy Research(KIER) as a research engineer since 2016.
          People around me keep saying that technology is the most importang thing to consider for halting climate change. 
          I can say that this experience originates from the fact that I'm working for an energy 'technology' research institute. 
          Of course, it is true. but I'm cerntain that there is something more than that what people do not take care of much about.
          Societal issues need to be addresed. There are and will be people being affected while we are heading for a carbon neutral society.
          Though there has been a discussion about justice when dealing climate issues,
          we rarely talk about what to do for ensuring safety of the poorest and most vulnerable people.
          I want to be the one who can analyze the impact of societal problems when dealing climate crisis.
          This is a crucial reason why I'm applying for KDIs.
   
          <p>Studied Industrial engineering for bachelor's degree, and broadend my knowledge by studying Electrical Engineering for master's degree.
          Experiences living abroad about 3 years for master's dergree was so valuable in a sense that I could think of 'diversity'.
          I am a majority in Korea(in that I'm a Korean), but experenced being a minor when living and studying witht people with different skin color, language, culture.
          This valuable experience still keeps me think of people with differnet conditions.
          One English journalist wrote a book called 'Korea, the impossible country'. I'd like to understand the impossibility of this country and even more..  
          </p>

     


 
    
    <p><h2>Research Interest</h2></p>
    <p>My research interest lies in climtate justice, just transition. Looking forward to learning civic data science. </p>
      <p> How to communicate efficiently and more asthetically pleasing way. -> Data visualization. </p> 
      <p>[Data] My interest has been in data. 
        Part of my work includes making data visualization charts and graph formats. 
        Its coverage varies from making a single chart with few variables that can be easily done with Excel
        to analyzing millions of data of electricity generation that could not be analized without programming languages.
        Although it took several months learning R as a data analysis and visualization tool to the level of practical use,
        I kept devoting myself to leaning new language and trying analysis and visualiztion. And it is time to declare that I will pursue my PHd in data science. 
        For building a competitive career in data science, I will take an life-changing oppurtunity for leaning dynamic and vibrant education program in KDIs.
        As a data scientist, I would like to analyze conflicts between reneable energy development and local communities' benefits, 
        employment opportunities from a coal-to-renewables transition, etc.
